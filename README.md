## Tech Stack

Now describe how your project works. What your team used for each part of the project: backend, frontend, etc. What technologies and libraries did you pull in. Describe any APIs intergrated with. Make sure to explain your decisions as if speaking to a new team member joining your project.

For the backend of our project, we utlized the Yummly API to search the necessary recipes for our current moods in display. We were influenced on using jQuery and a bit of a JSON parse to get the information from our API key/link.
