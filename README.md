## Problem Statement
People have a hard time deciding what to cook because of the lack of ingredients they know or their mood is affecting the process of choosing what meals to cook. 

## Project Description
Have you ever felt hangry (hungry + angry, for those that don't know), but couldn't find a simple recipe to complete? Or have you ever felt in the mood for a certain type of food, but couldn't find
that one recipe that would competely satisfy you? No need to worry, with "MOodY FOoDie" anyone can find the perfect recipe that fits your mood.




## Tech Stack


For the backend of our project, we use the Yummly API to search the necessary recipes for our current moods in display. We were influenced on using jQuery and a bit of a JSON parse to get the information from our API key/link.
